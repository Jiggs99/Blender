1. Light interacts differently based on the objects make up. If the object is black then the more light will be absorbed, but if the object is a mirror it will be reflected. Light also interacts differently in various environments such as a hotter or colder place. 

2. Everyone has different eyes and the colors that they see due to the various light hitting these objects. 

3. The YUV color space benefits human perception. 

4. Colors are added differently for lights because light works in a different way. RGB in paint mixes into a different color, while light may mix and appear with different shades as opposed to the paint which will be a solid color. 

5. Green is a color that is unlike the human skin tone so a green screen will pop in the back and will be easier for cameras to pick up what is not green. 

6. Tone mapping is needed to make the image look realistic on a display which wouldn't be seen otherwise. 

7. wavelenghts are reflected back into our eyes so every wave length has a corresponding color.
